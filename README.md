Cypher Workbook
=======
# Spoiler Alert
This repo contains my work on completing Cypher.  If you don't want spoilers, don't look in my files.

# About Cypher
Cypher is a game about cryptanalysis.  It takes you through the history of cryptography and gives you a bunch of cryptanalysis puzzles that get harder and harder, forming a ladder to climb.

# Tools
 * Mathematica
   - Most of my thought process and code is in Mathematica, which means you will need at least the free CDF viewer to look at it.
 * C
   - If I think a C program will be better than Mathematica at a task, I will create one and put it in this repo.
